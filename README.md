<h1> About Me </h1>
<p> Hi! My name is Farhan Alam. I'm a 16-year-old junior at Whitney High School in Cerritos, California. My favorite subjects are history and geography. </p>

<h2> History </h2>
<p>According to the Oxford Languages Dictionary, history is "the study of past events, particularly in human affairs." History is an interesting subject as it gives us insight about past occurrences and allows us to make decisions today based on how those occurrences played out. I feel that is important that people learn from their past mistakes, and learning about the history of various nations and peoples allows us to ponder on where people went right and where they went wrong, allowing us to not repeat the mistakes they did.</p>
