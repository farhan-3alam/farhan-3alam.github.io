<h2>History</h2>

<h3>Early Period</h3>
<p>In its early history, modern day Bangladesh saw a period of Hindu and Buddhist rule. The area was ruled over by various great Indian Hindu kingdoms like the Maurya and Gupta Empires, as well as the Buddhist Pala Empire. The Sena dynasty was the last empire to rule the Bengal region before the medieval period.</p>

<h3>Medieval Period</h3>
<p>The Bengal region's medieval history was marked by Islamic rule. The Ghurid dynasty conquered the Sena dynasty in 1204, after which the region became part of the Delhi Sultanate of India. The region enjoyed a brief period of independence from 1341 to 1576 under the Bengal Sultanate. During this time period, the Sultanate greatly expanded its borders as well as its economy, inviting traders from China and Europe. Even after Mughal conquest in 1576, Bengal was a popular place of economic activity as international merchants sought the region's highly-prized textiles of cotton and silk. As the Mughal Empire began to decline in the early 18th century, Bengal acquired semi-autonomy and was controlled by rulers known as Nawabs.</p>

<h3>British Period</h3>
<p>Bengal was conquered by the British in 1757, becoming a part of the British Empire as the Bengal Presidency. The conquer of Bengal gave way for the British to conquer the rest of the Indian subcontinent. During British rule, the Bengal region saw a decline in economic activity as the British took control of natural resources and raw materials, leading to the fall of the once-famous textile industry. British rule of the area was also marked by multiple famines, leading to the deaths of millions of people in the Bengal Presidency.</p>
